self.grid is a 159 * 159 2d list, each element is a node object, which node object has a point field (which is a tuple that stores the coordinates),
a unvisited field that indicates if this node has been visited or not, self.value store the actual content in this node.
self.G, self.H and self.parent is just some variables used in A* star algorithms. Do need to worry about these variables.

At the begin, the agent is at self.grid[80][80], since the map could be 80 * 80, the agent could be at corner, we need at least 159 * 159 grid to ensure 
the index would not out of range, and put the agent at middle, self.grid[80][80]

Then the children function would check its all 4 adjecent nodes, see if they are white space,

Take s0.in map for example:

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~  ***  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~ a*$*T ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~  *-*  ~~~~~~~~~~~~~
~~  ^  ~~~~~~~~~   ~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~  kT ~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~   ~~
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In this case, the agent is at (80, 80)
(79, 80) is '-', is not walkable, not store to self.unvisited
(80, 79) is ' ', is walkable, store it to self.unvisited
(80, 81) is ' ', is walkable, store it to self.unvisited
(81, 80) is '~', is not walkable, not store to self.unvisited

Now the self.unvisited would have two elements, [(80, 79), (80, 81)]
Pop the last element out, (80, 81), the take_action would return the action the agent needs to go from (80, 80) to (80, 81)
The acitons are 'r' 'f'

After taking the actions, the agent is at (80, 81), self.direction is '>'
then do the above steps again, store all the node that are adjacent to it, and is walkable, and also not visisted yet

(79, 81) is '*', is not walkable, not store it to self.unvisited
(80, 80) is already visited, not store to self.unvisted
(80, 82) is ' ', is walkable, store it to self.unvisited
(81, 81) is '~', is not walkable, not store it to self.unvisited

At this stage, self.unvisited has two elements: [(80, 79), (80, 82)]

Then pop the last one out, take_action function will reutrn the moves it need to go from (80, 81) to (80, 82)
the move is 'f'


Do the aboev steps over and over again, the agent would be able to traval to all the wite spaces it can reach at the first place
